            <head>Women’s Suffrage</head>           
            <p>In one of his interesting articles on current politics, Mr. Matthew Arnold not long ago congratulated his country on having made a definite step forward in the path of civilisation. “Twenty years and more,” he said, “have now gone by since, in a lecture at Oxford, I quoted the declaration of a member of Parliament, a friend of mine, that a thing’s being an anomaly was in his opinion no objection to it whatever; and I remarked that, at any rate, perhaps the labours of the friends of light might be trusted to prevail so far as this – that in twenty years’ time it should be thought, even in England, an objection to a thing that it is absurd. And this is really what has come about. The epoch of concentration has ended, the ice has broken up, things are no longer looked upon as a part of the order of creation merely because we find them existing. If they are absurd, this is now a positive objection to them; they become impossible as well, and have to be got rid of.” He then gives an illustration from the existing condition of Church patronage, and adds, “The body of quiet reasonable people throughout the country, whose goodwill is so essential to a Government, have come, I say, to perceive when a thing of this kind is brought to their notice that it is absurd; it is felt to be absurd, and its long continuance becomes therefore impossible.”</p>
           <p> Now if we apply this principle to the position of women with regard to the representative institutions of this country, I think we may say that the labours of the friends of light, from John Stuart Mill downwards, during the last twenty years have succeeded in proving that the exclusion of all women, except one, from direct political power is an anomaly; it is felt by the great body of quiet reasonable people throughout the country to be absurd, and its long continuance becomes therefore impossible.</p>
           <p> Some of the more glaring features of this anomaly and absurdity may be pointed out. Some years ago, before the two great extensions of the suffrage in 1867 and 1884, the possession of the Parliamentary franchise was a privilege entrusted to a selected few.The exclusion of women at that time might have been either expedient or inexpedient, just or unjust, but it was not an anomaly, it was not absurd. Certain classes of persons were selected for this privilege, and to them it was confided in trust, as it were, for the rest of the community. The women who were excluded were not selected for a special disability of sex, but were associated in their exclusion with large bodies of their countrymen, to whom no exception on the ground of character and capacity could be taken. Now, however, the basis of the Constitution has been changed. The franchise is no longer a privilege granted to the selected few on the grounds of personal fitness, or, at any rate, on the presumed absence of unfitness, but is a right extended to the great mass of the people. The government of this country is now “broad based upon the people’s will.” The avowed intention of the Government which passed the Reform Act of 1884, not at all consistently acted on so far as women were concerned, was to admit within the pale of the Constitution all capable citizens, be they few or many; and if they were many, it was said, so much the better. Even felons were not excluded when once their term of imprisonment was over; and lunatics were joyfully admitted if they could be proved to have voted in a lucid interval. Paupers also are sometimes discharged from workhouses in order to vote.</p>
           <p> We have, therefore, an all-embracing franchise, from which no man – however ignorant, criminal, pauperised, or imbecile – is permanently excluded. The only class of persons upon whom the badge and stigma of political disability is now permanently fixed, consists of those who within the last century have mustered within their ranks such names as those of Jane Austen, Charlotte and Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Mrs. Gaskell, Mrs. Hemans, Jean Ingelow, Caroline Herschel, Mary Somerville, Harriet Martineau, Dorothy Wordsworth, Caroline Norton, Octavia Hill, Florence Nightingale, Mary Carpenter, Sister Dora, Grace Darling, and Josephine Butler. I do not, however, desire in any way to concentrate the attention of my readers on the brilliant women of genius in which this century has been so rich. It is possible to prove the anomaly and absurdity of the entire exclusion of women from political privileges without quoting any names that belong to the Upper Ten Thousand of mental and moral power. </p>
            <p>Take any ordinary country parish, or any ordinary street in a country town, and many familiar examples from everyday life may be found in each of them illustrate the absurdity of denying to women alone, out of the entire community, the power to vote for members of Parliament. In this country village you find, perhaps, a woman left a widow, with a farm on her hands. She cultivates the farm for the benefit of her children. By careful economy, and by a judicious choice of persons to whom her business interests can be entrusted, she succeeds in making the farm answer, and in securing the means of bringing up her family in refinement and comfort. She employs a certain number of labourers – some diligent, trustworthy, and intelligent; and some, it is to be feared, ignorant, idle, and dissolute. To all these men alike, if they are householders, Parliament has seen fit in its wisdom to delegate some part of the sovereign power of governing this vast empire. To them all is now confided the right of having a hand – and, if need be, a controlling hand – in the management of the affairs of the nation. The whole staff of the farm have votes; there is only one exception, and that is in the person of the woman whose capital, energy, and good sense to keep the whole thing going. Her carters, her shepherds, her ploughmen, and her hedgers and ditchers may vote; but she, equally interested with them in all that maintains the happiness and the prosperity of the Empire, is excluded. Or take such an example as may be found in a street of a country town. A member of Parliament is perhaps canvassing with his agent in the main street of such a town. He makes a house-to-house visitation; and if there are some objections to canvassing, at any rate his visits afford an opportunity of political conversation that has, as far as it goes, a good educational effect. It also makes the personality of the candidate known to his future constituents. They can judge in a personal interview, better than in almost any other way, whether the man is honest and to be trusted, or self-seeking and wily. As he approaches one house his agent stops him and says, “It is no good going there; its owner is only a woman.” She pays rates and taxes, like all the other people in the street; she may chance to know more of the poor and the outcast of the town than any one else in it; but she is only a woman, she has no vote, and the time of the member or candidate is too precious to be devoted to those who have nothing to give him in return. The exception of this one householder from the privileges enjoyed by her neighbours is an anomaly and an absurdity, and surely the labours of the friends of light have so far prevailed as to secure that its long continuance has become impossible. It would be easy to multiply to an indefinite extent instances of this absurdity of including every creature (fit or unfit) of one sex, and excluding every creature (fit or unfit) of the other from the privileges of representation; but it is unnecessary to do so. If the object is to admit all capable citizens within the pale of the Constitution, it is as unjustifiable to exclude on the ground of sex as it is to exclude on the ground of creed or colour.</p>
            <p>We all know stories illustrating the extreme ignorance of some of the new voters. One lady on the day of the election asked her coachman if he had exercised the franchise, and he replied, “If you please, m’m, which horse be that?” A man I know very well replied, when canvassed by the Tory candidate, “Yes, my lord, I shall vote for you; your grandfather and mine was wounded in the same battle.” I do not say or think that these men ought not to have had votes. The possession of a vote is often a first step in political education; but it is cruel, in the face of all the important political questions which await solution, to admit hundreds and thousands of men in the lowest depths of ignorance concerning politics and history, whilst women of intelligence and education are kept out.</p>
            <p>The absurdity and incongruity of the present state of things does not stop here. It is further exemplified by the fact that women are taking, and are constantly called in by all parties to take, an increasingly active part in political life. The extraordinary activity of the ladies of the Primrose League is well known. Whether their action is approved or disapproved, there seems to be a general agreement that the result of the last two General Elections was considerably affected by it. And if it is correct that imitation is the truest flattery, the Primrose League has been flattered by a very general imitation of its machinery on the part of the Liberal Party. At the meeting of the National Liberal Federation at Leeds, the President, Sir James Kitson, said that among the signs of encouragement for the Liberal Party was the activity of many ladies in its behalf. Women’s Liberal Associations, he said, were being actively founded, twenty-three were already in existence, and he considered it the duty of Liberals to encourage the formation of a still larger number.</p>
           <p> Even from across the seas, from distant India, a voice comes to the women of England, asking them to help in the settlement of some all-important social reforms there. Many people in England are watching with painful interest a battle that is being waged in India against the horrible custom of infant marriage. The reformers lately appealed for a word of advice and encouragement to Professor Max Miller. What was the gist of his reply? His counsel was: “Write a short pamphlet containing nothing but well-known and well-authenticated facts, and send it to the women of England. They begin to be a power, and they have one splendid quality – they are never beaten. If they once know what is going on in India, tolerated by an English Government, they will tell every candidate for Parliament, ‘Unless this blot is removed from the escutcheon of England, you shall not be re-elected.’ Women,” he continued, “at all events, have courage, and when they see what is hideous they do not wait for orders before they say what they think.” I fear the Professor takes a too favourable view of the extent of the power exercised by women. There have been many things perpetrated under the direct sanction of the English Government in India and in every British colony which it is a shame even to think of, and which the best women in England have been breaking their hearts over for the last dozen years, but have not yet effectually stopped. Stilled, it cannot be denied that, with allowance for exaggeration, the Professor is right, and that the reform of the infamous marriage laws of India would be enormously hastened if the women of England were once roused on the subject. Surely when women are called upon to exert themselves actively on behalf of every party in the State, when reformers from distant empires implore their aid, and when their influence is felt as a thing to be keenly desired or keenly resented, according as it is used on this side or that, it is too late to say that women have nothing to do with politics, and should therefore be excluded from the Parliamentary franchise. </p>
              <p> Let me give an instance of another way in which women are not only invited, but forced even, under the existing state of things, to have a share in politics. Every one knows that when there is an election petition at any place, and the judge reports that in his opinion corrupt practices have extensively prevailed, a commission consisting of three judges is sent to the place, with power to examine witnesses and to hold a judicial inquiry into the extent to which the political life of the place has been vitiated by bribery. These commissions are costly affairs; the expenses often amount to 2,000 or [11] 3,000. This sum has to be defrayed by the ratepayers of the town in which the commission has been held. Now it may be very fairly argued that this was a matter in which women really had no concern. The corrupt practices of the men of the town have necessitated a costly inquiry, and it would therefore appear obvious that all men would immediately see that it was their part to pay the bill without calling upon the women ratepayers to contribute a single farthing. But this has never been the view taken in any of the towns in which these inquiries have been held. The women are not only invited, but forced, to take part in politics on these occasions; they have to pay the penalty of an abuse of representative power, although they are excluded from all the benefits arising from the power of voting. If the general position of women with regard to the law is looked at, the same remark holds good; they are held to be equal with men if there is any penalty to pay, but their inequality appears again if there is any privilege to be bestowed.</p>
                 <p> Let no man or woman be mistaken as to what this movement for women’s suffrage really means. We none of us want to turn the world upside-down or convert women into men. We want women, on the contrary, above all things to continue womanly – womanly in the highest and best sense – and to bring their true woman’s influence on behalf of whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of good report, to bear upon the conduct of public affairs. Some people attempt to meet the claim of women to representation by the absurdly irrelevant remark, for I cannot call it an argument, that women householders ought not to vote for members of Parliament because they cannot be policeman and cannot be soldiers. Who wants them to be either policeman or soldiers? There must always be a certain division of labour between the sexes. The physical constitution of a woman fits her to perform certain duties on which the welfare of society in a high degree depends. The physical constitution of a man fits him for certain other duties, one of which is that of external defence. And there are certain other duties which men and women must undertake jointly and in co-operation with one another, and from which the total withdrawal of one sex or the other is fraught with danger and mischief. Those who are in favour of women’s suffrage maintain that the duty of loving  one’s country, of understanding her interests, of endeavouring to influence public affairs by the choice of men of high character and true patriotism to serve in Parliament, is one which is incumbent on women as well as on men. There is nothing in the nature of a woman which fits her to be a policeman or a soldier; and there is nothing in the nature of a woman which unfits her to love her country and to serve her by helping to send good men to promote sound legislation in Parliament.</p>
                    <p> People sometimes talk as if fighting for one’s country were the only way of serving her. Surely that is taking a very one-sided view of a nation’s interests. All work well done, all service in lifting up the lives of others to a higher level, “All we have wished or hoped or dreamed of good,” forms the real treasury of national greatness. I have no wish to disparage the usefulness, the necessity, of the army and the police force; but civilisation owes quite as much to that great host of silent busy workers, of whom at least half are women, through whose labours alone there is anything worth preserving, as to the army and the police force for preserving it.</p>
                       <p> Another absurdity connected with this argument that women should not vote because they cannot be soldiers, is made obvious by the mere mention of the existence of non-combatant men. The position of women with regard to the army is exactly the same as that of non-combatants of the other sex; they do not fight themselves, but they pay other people to fight for them.</p>
                       <p> The labours of the friends of light have so far prevailed as to sweep away all the disabilities of creed: will they not also suffice to sweep away the disabilities of sex in respect to all those duties and privileges for the acceptance of which no disability has been imposed by nature? Some time ago Mr. Frederick Myers, speaking on this subject, said, “Disabilities of sex are parallel to disabilities of creed, except that disabilities of sex have for the most part been imposed by passions less respectable than theological bigotry. But the spirit which maintains both classes of disabilities is the same, for some men are afraid to do justice to unbelievers for fear the truth should collapse; that is their infidelity to God. And some men are afraid to do justice to women for fear the attributes of the sexes should be confounded; that is their infidelity to nature.” Faith in the laws of God and nature is best shown by boldly removing every injustice under which women labour, confident that what is truly beautiful and noble in womanhood not only will not suffer thereby, but will shine out with a clearer radiance, and will bring a purifying influence to bear on our social and political life.</p>
                          <p> The Woman’s Suffrage Bill, which was again introduced last session, has received the approval, in some form or another, of more than half the House of Commons. It is not a party measure, but is supported by members of all parties. In this lies both its strength and its weakness. The Bill has suffered again and again for lack of the motive-power which the party organisation of politics in this country would have supplied if we had been able to call it into activity on our behalf. We cannot promise either of the two great parties that all the women will be on their side. Therefore the party Radical opposes women’s suffrage because, he says, “women are Conservatives;” and the party Conservative opposes us because, he says, “women are red-hot Radicals.” Thus very often we have fallen between two stools. Nevertheless, it is a strength to the women’s suffrage cause – which carries conviction to the quiet reasonable people in the country, on whose good-will a Government depends – that the Bill for the enfranchisement of women householders has been consistently supported for many years by many of the best men of all parties. A measure that has been supported by such men as John Stuart Mill, Lord Beaconsfield, Sir Stafford Northcote, Mr. Henley, Mr. Russell Gurney, Mr. Henry Fawcett, Mr. Duncan McLaren, Mr. Courtney, the Duke of Rutland, and Lord Carnarvon, is one that is likely in [12] the end to commend itself to the judgement and conscience of the English people. The Bill proceeds on the same lines which have already governed the extension to women of the School Board and municipal franchises. It is not a Bill for the general enfranchisement of all women, but it is strictly a household suffrage Bill. It would complete the reform of our representative system in the direction of household suffrage by giving all women who are ratepayers and heads of households the privilege and protection of representation. The Bill would add about 800,000 women to the present electorate, and on the average it would add, if it were passed, about twelve women to every hundred male voters in the constituencies. </p>
                          <p> Some of our friends think we are wrong not to have gone further and demanded a more general enfranchisement of women, which would include wives as well as women who were heads of households. This was a matter which deserved and received very careful attention from those responsible for the Bill; and it was felt that the Bill as it now stands, limited as it is, unites the real supporters of the principle of women’s suffrage more a than a more widely extended measure would do. Many of those who urge us to go further are, no doubt, entirely sincere in their advice; but some who urge it are, perhaps, not altogether in favour of the principle we are advocating. They wish us to go further because they think we should fare worse. When Admiral Maxse and Professor Goldwin Smith express their entire disapproval of the limitation of the Bill, we must be excused if we regard their advice with something of the suspicion which would animate a farmer to whom a fox generously offers good advice as to how to guard the hen-roost. But to every one who genuinely wishes  to extend to women the blessings of citizenship, we would listen with the greatest respect; and if any of them think that Mr. Woodall’s Bill does not go far enough, I would only ask them to reflect that all enfranchising measures have proceeded in our country slowly and gradually; and that in an army, if we are to keep shoulder to shoulder, the quick and strong must accommodate their pace to the weakly and less rapid. It is difficult to conceive that any one genuinely in favour of women’s suffrage would decline to support the Bill because it does not go far enough.</p>
                             <p> The main considerations in support of the Bill are that women are not unfitted by reason of their sex from forming a judgment on political questions; that the representation of women would tend to secure the speedy amendment of laws unjust to women, and to prevent the passing of new laws injurious to them; that it would give additional weight in Parliament to the consideration of the domestic as well as the political results of legislation; and that, if the claim of women to representation is just, the moral sense of the nation is injured by their continued exclusion.</p>
